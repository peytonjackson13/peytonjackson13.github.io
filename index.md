# FAVORITE CPSC120 LABS

Lab 11, Part 1
This is my favorite lab because it taught me object oriented programming. In the main function we are trying to find the most dense and least populated states. It also introduced string streams. 

Lab 10, Part 1
This was a fun lab because we used strings in vectors to find the counties in a state. I learned to iterate over a variable into a vector. If the variable is found in the vector then it will convert the second element of the variable into an integer since it was originally a string. 

Lab 8, Part 1
For this lab, we wrote the average mean of the elements in the vector while disincluding the lowest and highest values. I also liked the simplicity of this lab as it showed me how coding can be used in a more practical way.
